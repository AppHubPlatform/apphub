apphub-ios is an iOS client for [AppHub](https://apphub.io).

AppHub lets you instantly update React Native apps without resubmitting to the App Store.

Special thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) by providing generous testing support and resources.

#### Features

- Instantly update app code and images without resubmitting to TestFlight or the App Store.
- Manage compatability between multiple native and JavaScript versions of your app.
- Download updates in the background, or while your app is executing.
- Seamlessly "hot swap" updates during app use.
- Require that testers and users are on the latest version of your app.


## Getting Started

The [AppHub Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.apphub.io) is a service which hosts and manages versions of your React Native app. [Sign up with GitHub](https://dashboard.apphub.io) to get started.

Once you sign up, the dashboard will walk you through incorporating the AppHub SDK into your React Native app.

## Hosting your own AppHub Server

Some developers wish to configure their own backend to host and serve builds to mobile clients. This is an advanced feature; most developers choose to use AppHub hosting and the AppHub developer dashboard.

See the [AppHub docs](http://docs.apphub.io/v1.0/docs/self-hosting) for full documentation on self-hosting.
