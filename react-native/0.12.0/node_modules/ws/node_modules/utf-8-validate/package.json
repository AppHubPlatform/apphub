This was unfortunately not possible in JavaScript, hence the\nneed for a binary addon.\n\nAs the module consists of binary components, it should be used an\n`optionalDependency` so when installation fails, it doesn't halt the\ninstallation of your module. There are fallback files available in this\nrepository. See `fallback.js` for the suggest fallback implementation if\ninstallation fails. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install utf-8-validate\n```\n\n## API\n\nIn all examples we assume that you've already required the mdoule as\nfollowed:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar isValid = require('utf-8-validate').isValidUTF8;\n```\n\nThe module exposes 1 function:\n\n#### isValidUTF8\n\nValidate if the passed in buffer contains valid UTF-8 chars.\n\n```js\nbu.isValidUTF8(buffer);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
