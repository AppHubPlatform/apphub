  "readme": "# fb-watchman\n\n`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the\n[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from\nFacebook.\n\nWatchman provides file change notification services using very\nefficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and\nfilesystem tree querying operations using\n[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).\n\n## Install\n\nYou should [install Watchman](\nhttps://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this\nmodule.\n\nThen simply:\n\n```\n$ npm install fb-watchman\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Watchman recursively watches directories.\n- Each watched directory is called a `root`.\n- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes\n- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)\n- change notifications are relative to the project root\n\n## How do I use it?\n\n[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)\n",
