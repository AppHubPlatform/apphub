There are a few things that lead to this performance advantage, none of them hard and fast rules, but all of them simple and repeatable in almost any code library:\n\n1. Optimize around the fastest and most common use cases first. Of course, this will change from project-to-project, but I took some time to understand how and why `typeof` checks were being used in my own libraries and other libraries I use a lot.\n2. Optimize around bottlenecks - In other words, the order in which conditionals are implemented is significant, because each check is only as fast as the failing checks that came before it. Here, the biggest bottleneck by far is checking for plain objects (an object that was created by the `Object` constructor). I opted to make this check happen by process of elimination rather than brute force up front (e.g. by using something like `val.constructor.name`), so that every other type check would not be penalized it.\n3. Don't do uneccessary processing - why do `.slice(8, -1).toLowerCase();` just to get the word `regex`? It's much faster to do `if (type === '[object RegExp]') return 'regex'`\n\n## Running tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
