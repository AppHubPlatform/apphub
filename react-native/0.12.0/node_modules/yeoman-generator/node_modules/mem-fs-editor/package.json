  "readme": "mem-fs-editor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/mem-fs-editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/mem-fs-editor)\n=============\n\nFile edition helpers working on top of [mem-fs](https://github.com/SBoudrias/mem-fs)\n\nUsage\n-------------\n\n```js\nvar memFs = require('mem-fs');\nvar editor = require('mem-fs-editor');\n\nvar store = memFs.create();\nvar fs = editor.create(store);\n\nfs.write('somefile.js', 'var a = 1;');\n```\n\n### `#read(filepath, [options])`\n\nRead a file and return its contents as a string.\n\nYou can alternatively get the raw contents buffer if you pass `options.raw = true`.\n\nBy default, calling `read()` on a file path that does not exist throws error. You can, however, pass `options.defaults = 'your default content'` to get a default content you pass in, if you prefer to not deal with try/catch.\n\n### `#readJSON(filepath, [defaults])`\n\nRead a file and parse its contents as JSON.\n\n`readJSON()` internally calls `read()` and will throw error if the file path you pass in does not exist. But if you pass in an optional `defaults`, the `defaults` content will be returned in case of the target file is missing, instead of throwing error (error would still be thrown if JSON.parse failed to parse your target file).\n\n### `#write(filepath, contents)`\n\nReplace the content of a file (existing or new) with a string or a buffer.\n\n### `#writeJSON(filepath, contents[, replacer [, space]])`\n\nReplace the content of a file (existing or new) with an object that is to be converted by calling `JSON.stringify()`.\n\n`contents` should usually be a JSON object, but it can technically be anything that is acceptable by [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).\n\nOptionally pass `replacer` and `space` as the last two arguments, as defined by [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). `spacer` is used to format the output string (prettify).\n\nDefault value for `space` is `2`, when not specified.\n\n### `#delete(filepath, [options])`\n\nDelete a file or a directory.\n\n`filePath` can also be a `glob`. If `filePath` is glob, you can optionally pass in an `options.globOptions` object to change its pattern matching behavior. The full list of options are being described [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options). The `sync` flag is forced to be `true` in `globOptions`.\n\n### `#copy(from, to, [options])`\n\nCopy a file from the `from` path to the `to` path.\n\nOptionally, pass an `options.process` function (`process(contents)`) returning a string or a buffer who'll become the new file content. The process function will take a single contents argument who is the copied file contents as a `Buffer`.\n\n`from` can be a glob pattern that'll be match against the file system. If that's the case, then `to` must be an output directory. For a globified `from`, you can optionally pass in an `options.globOptions` object to change its pattern matching behavior. The full list of options are being described [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options). The `nodir` flag is forced to be `true` in `globOptions` to ensure a vinyl object representing each matching directory is marked as `deleted` in the `mem-fs` store.\n\n### `#copyTpl(from, to, context, [options])`\n\nCopy the `from` file and parse its content as an [ejs](http://ejs.co/) template where `context` is the template context (the variable names available inside the template).\n\nYou can optionally pass a template `options` object. `mem-fs-editor` automatically setup the filename option so you can easily use partials.\n\nTemplates syntax looks like this:\n\n```\n<%= value %>\n<%- include('partial.ejs', { name: 'Simon' }) %>\n```\n\nRefer to the [ejs documentation](http://ejs.co/) for more details.\n\n### `#move(from, to, [options])`\n\nMove/rename a file from the `from` path to the `to` path.\n\n`#move` internally uses `#copy` and `#delete`, so `from` can be a glob pattern, and you can provide `options.globOptions` with it.\n\n### `#exists(filepath)`\n\nReturns `true` if a file exists. Returns `false` if the file is not found or deleted.\n\n### `#commit([filters,] callback)`\n\nPersist every changes made to files in the mem-fs store to disk.\n\nIf provided, `filters` is an array of TransformStream to be applied on a stream of vinyl files (like gulp plugins).\n\n`callback` is called once the files are updated on disk.\n",
